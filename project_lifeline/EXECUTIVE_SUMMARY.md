## Client Project Executive Summary: FEMA Lifeline Categorization via Yelp!

Businesses with a community can be an essential part of critical functions without knowing their importance.  Although certain types of infrastructure such as energy distribution, hospitals, or fire services will be automatically collected and mapped by relevant federal/state/municipal agencies, smaller community lifelines such as cultural centers, records keeping, or food distribution might not have as robust documenting and mapping.  As well, these smaller lifelines might not have effective ways of communicating their operational status after a disaster either to civilians or disaster relief personnel.

Yelp! is a website that catalogues and reviews businesses worldwide powered through user generated listings and reviews.  Certain FEMA lifeline categories such as those in Energy or Communications will probably not have a majority of their infrastructure listed in Yelp, if at all, but those resources are already well known, mapped, and maintained by their appropriate Federal agencies or private operators.  Yelp!'s utility for this project will be to help us gather data on smaller businesses that still have significant disaster relief value but might be small enough to not gain the attention at a federal mapping level.

A radius of 30km around downtown Boston will be set and data for businesses that fall within FEMA defined lifeline categories will have their data scraped through the Yelp! Fusion API.  Only zip codes that fall within the 30km radius will have their businesses scraped, and these lifeline businesses will be categorized and put on an interactive zip code map summarizing lifeline statistics for each category.  As well, population and mean home price will be included in this interactive map as a step towards future analysis for these zip codes. Certain zip codes missing population or home price data will not be imputed due to the specific nature of certain missing zip codes, but lifeline information is still available.

Future application of this sort of map could be used to create a website where lifeline businesses or users can register and update their operational status before, during, and after a disaster, allowing for accessible information on where essential emergency resources can be found.  As data professionals, our goal is to take advantage of the potential available to us with crowdsourced data on smaller businesses to create solutions that contribute to disaster relief.  Although this is a surface level categorization that is not integrated with existing lifeline databases, it can greatly contribute to future database generation and hopefully save lives in the event of widespread regional emergencies.
